## How to Perform Power Calculations for your Project, Step by Step

<div class="ref-summary" markdown="1">
This page walks through the sequence of steps for planning a power calculation for a project: what information to gather first, how to get a rough sample size estimate, and how that estimate gets refined. Use it to understand the order of the steps, not as the calculation itself.
</div>

<hr class="section-divider">

First, we have to gather intelligence on the three most fundamental things:

-   What is the expected mean of our variable of interest?
-   How much do values deviate from this mean in reality?
-   Which effect size can we expect roughly from our intervention?

<!-- from csazr list 2019 translating critical values to optimal sample size requires knowledge of the variance of the outcome—a parameter unknown prior to conducting the experiment. This feature makes ex ante power calculations inherently hypothetical, as they are based on the researcher's expectations about the underlying data generating process (Gelman and Carlin 2014). -->

<!-- When deciding what effect size to target, researchers should consider what difference is actually practically or economically relevant—an aspect that is still largely overlooked both at the design and the inference stage.53 A useful practice is to express minimum detectable effect sizes in terms of standard deviation changes to facilitate comparison with existing studies in the field (e.g., the researcher may desire to have her experiment detect a 0.1 standard deviation treatment effect). -->

In case we want (or have) to assign treatment at a cluster or group level, we also need to gather information on the degree of similarity within each cluster or group.
This descriptive statistic is often referred to as the Intra-cluster Correlation Coefficient (ICC).

## Start with a scenario

> You are designing an RCT that will assign treatment at the village level rather than at the individual level. You have already found a household survey from a similar context to estimate the mean and standard deviation of your outcome variable, and you have looked at evaluations of comparable interventions to guess at a plausible effect size.

Is that enough information to run the power calculation?

<summary>Think it through, then expand</summary>

Not quite. The mean, the standard deviation, and the effect size are the three fundamental inputs, but because treatment is assigned at the village (cluster) level rather than at the individual level, you also need to know the degree of similarity within each village, the Intra-cluster Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Without it, a sample size calculated as if individuals were assigned independently will understate how many villages (and individuals within them) are actually needed to detect the effect.

Notice also what would not be a shortcut here: running a small pilot to estimate these parameters is not advised, since pilots are typically too small to give reliable estimates of variance or ICC.

The relevant pieces of information can be gathered through a review of similar studies that were carried out in the past, the analysis of surveys and/or administrative data, or, ideally, a combination of the two.
It is not advised to rely on pilot studies for power calculations due to small sample size problems.

As a first step we always use basic plug-in formulas to get a rough sense for the needed sample size.
This serves as a benchmark and can/will be refined later by controlling for important covariates/predictors which usually soak up some of the variation in the variable of interest, reducing variance in the residuals of the regression and thus lowering the required sample size for any specified level of precision or power.
Similar gains can be achieved by stratification/blocking.
For more complex settings we usually want to resort to simulation methods in a final step.
This is something where we would recommend using R.

When computing the needed sample size for an RCT, one of the most important questions we have to answer is what is the smallest difference in the average of the outcome variable between treatment and control group that we would like to be able to detect.
As a primer, we will quickly revisit conventional two-sample hypothesis testing in order to see the role effect size, $\delta$, and standard deviation of the outcome, $\sigma$, play in the process.
