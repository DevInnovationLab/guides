## Individual Level Randomization

Individual-level randomization occurs when the treatment is assigned to individuals. 
This section discusses individual-level randomization with continuous and binary outcomes 
In the next section we will then look at these two cases when the treatment is assigned at a cluster or group level.
Everything else equal, clustered randomization lead to a decrease in power compared to individual randomization due to the non-independence of units within each group.
**We therefore generally would prefer to design a study that allows us to randomize at the individual level.**

### Continuous Outcomes

In order to test whether an RCT with simple randomization had a significant effect, in theory one does not even need a regression.
A simple difference in means by treatment status is unbiased for the average effect.
In order to obtain an average treatment effect, we just run the following univariate regression:

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D_i + \varepsilon_i,$$ 

where $$D$$ is an indicator variable that indicates whether individual $$i$$ received the treatment or not.
$$\varepsilon$$ is an iid error term.

We are interested in the hypothesis test of whether $$\beta_1$$ is different from zero,
<!-- The chosen significance level, i.e. the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact true (the so-called type I error rate), is typically assumed to be 5% for a two-sided test. -->
where rejecting the null hypothesis $$H_0: \beta_1 = 0$$ would show a significant effect of a treatment.
That is, we would like to know the probability that our study has of uncovering a true effect when estimating $$\beta_1$$.
Writing down this hypothesis test formally, it is straightforward to derive a closed-form solution for the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE), given a sample size, and the required sample size, $$N^*$$, to detect a difference in means $$\delta$$ given the standard deviation of the outcome.

The standard deviation of the outcome is usually unknown and hence needs an estimation -- or a best guess.
Estimating the standard deviation of the outcome can be difficult, specially if there is little prior work on the study's subject and context.
However, it is necessary to conduct power calculations, and data collection is often the only good way to get a credible estimate.[^1]

We can either assume that the variance of the outcome is homogeneous across the treated and control group, and the standard deviation is $$\sigma$$, or we can assume that the variance is different for the two groups, and the standard deviations are $$\sigma_0, \sigma_1$$ respectively.
We only focus on the first case here.

The Minimum Detectable Effect that can be detected with $$1 − \beta$$ power at significance level $$\alpha$$ is 

$$\delta = \left(t_\beta + t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right)\sigma\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_0}+\frac{1}{n_1}},$$ 

where $$n_0, n_1$$ are the sample size in the treatment and control group respectively.

Assuming that the sample size in the treatment and control groups are the same, $$n_0=n_1=n^*$$, the sample size needed for each group is $$n^* = 2\left(t_\beta + t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right)^2\frac{\sigma^2}{\delta^2},$$ implying that the total sample size needed is $$N^* = 2n^*$$.
<!-- Under the second hypothesis of heterogeneous variance, the MDE that can be detected with $$1 − \beta$$ power at significance level $$\alpha$$ is -->
 <!-- $$\delta = \left(z_\beta + z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right)\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_0^2}{n_0}+\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1}}$$ --> 
 <!-- where $$\sigma_0, \sigma_1$$ are the standard deviation of the outcome variable $$Y$$ for the treatment and control groups respectively, and $$n_0, n_1$$ are the sample size in the treatment and control group respectively.  -->

<!-- The expression for the sample size is -->

<!-- $$N^* = \left(z_\beta + z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right)^2\frac{1}{\delta^2}\left(\frac{\sigma_0^2}{\pi_0^*}+\frac{\sigma_1^2}{\pi_1^*}\right)$$ -->

<!-- where $$\pi_0^* = \frac{\sigma_0}{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}$$ and $$\pi_1^* = \frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}$$. The optimal allocation of the treatment and control group would be $$n_0^* = \pi_0^* N, n_1^* = \pi_1^* N$$. -->

**In practice we will estimate MDE or sample size with R's function `power.t.test()` (or alternatively with the corresponding function from the package `pwr`).**
A good discussion of Stata equivalents can be found [in the DIME Wiki](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Power_Calculations_in_Stata).
In all of the above we implicitly assumed that the treatment has only an effect on the mean - which is by far the most common assumption and usually what we are interested in.
<!-- For cases where the treatment also affects the variance of the distribution for one group, see the discussion in @ListSadoffWagner2011 and @McConnellVera-Hernandez2015. -->

### Binary Outcomes

When the outcome variable is binary, power calculations are more straightforward, as the standard deviation is implied by the Bernoulli distribution, $$p*(1-p)$$, with its highest value at a base rate of 0.5.

To obtain the required sample size, we can measure the effect size in terms of differences in the probability of success: 

$$ N^{*}=\left(\frac{p_{1}\left(1-p_{1}\right)}{\pi}+\frac{p_{0}\left(1-p_{0}\right)}{1-\pi}\right) \frac{\left(z_{\beta}+z_{\alpha / 2}\right)^{2}}{\left(p_{1}-p_{0}\right)^{2}},$$ 

where $$p_{0}$$ is the probability of success or an event rate, and $$p_{1} = p_0 \times (1-MDE)$$.
$$\pi$$ represents the fraction of the sample that is treated and $$z$$ refers to the respective values from the standard normal distribution.

**In practice, like in the continuous case, we can also use the built-in function `power.prop.test()`.**


[^1]: It is common for studies to rely on survey pilots for an estimate of the standard deviation of the outcome variable. When doing so, researchers should take into account that pilot samples are usually small, so estimates of data moments are noisy by construction.
